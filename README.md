## 🎯 Project Overview
The goal was to create a responsive, brand-compliant, and event-focused website. Unlike standard event pages, this project reflects the **exclusive nature** of LINK CAMP by featuring a "Selection Process" timeline rather than a generic ticket purchase flow.

### Key Features:
* **IEEE Brand Compliance:** Strictly adheres to IEEE guidelines using official colors (`#00629B`), fonts (Open Sans), and logo placement policies.
* **Dynamic Hero Section:** Features the official event date (Jan 24, 2026) and location (Kochi).
* **Selection Process Timeline:** A custom visual guide explaining the Task → Interview → Camp flow.
* **Mobile First Design:** Fully responsive navigation and grid layouts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility.
* **CSS3:** CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid, and Animations.
* **JavaScript:** Lightweight DOM manipulation for mobile navigation.
